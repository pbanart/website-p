In this project, I worked with latex. I made a mold of a planter with latex. I filled it up with dirt and planted sprouting sweet peas in it. I cut my previous work The circle into pieces. It was on an unstretched canvas so I  cut them up, soaked the pieces in rainwater to make them blend in this natural setting.
I also created a painting that portrays a wound that is stitched up. I projected the photograph of the painting on the wall. I also laid the canvas  
The projection represented my grieving mind, which is still gradually healing. The planter represents body
